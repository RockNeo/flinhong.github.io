description: In geometry, a solid angle is the two-dimensional angle in three-dimensional space that an object subtends at a point. It is a measure of how large the object appears to an observer looking from that point. In the International System of Units, a solid angle is expressed in a dimensionless unit called a steradian.

In geometry, a solid angle (symbol: Î©) is the two-dimensional angle in three-dimensional space that an object subtends at a point. It is a measure of how large the object appears to an observer looking from that point. In the International System of Units (SI), a solid angle is expressed in a dimensionless unit called a steradian (symbol: sr). [via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle)]

In light measurement, the geometry quantity of a **solid angle Î©** quantifies a part of an observer's visual field. If we imagine an observer located at point P, his full visual field can be described by a sphere of arbitrary radius r (see the following figure).

**Fig.** The solid angle â„¦ quantifies a certain part of the visual field, seen by an observer located at P.

Then, a certain part of this full visual field defines an area A on the sphere's surface and the solid angle **Î©** is defined by

$$\Omega  = \frac{A}{r^2}$$

As the area A is proportional to \\({r^2}\\), this fraction is independent of actual choice of r.

If we want to calculate the solid angle determined by a cone, as shown in the figure, area A is the area of a spherical calotte. However, as the solid angle is not only defined for conical parts of the full visual field, area A can be any arbitrary shape on the sphere's surface.

Although Î© is dimensionless, it is common to use the unit **steradian (sr)**.

The observer's total visual field is described by the whole surface of the sphere, which is given by \\(4\pi {r^2}\\), and thus covers the solid angle:

$${\Omega _{total}} = {4\pi {r^2} \over {r^2}} = 4\pi \;sr = 12.57\;sr$$
