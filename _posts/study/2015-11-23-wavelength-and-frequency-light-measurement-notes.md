The wavelength and frequency of light are closely related. The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength. Because all light waves move through a vacuum at the same speed, the number of wave crests passing by a given point in one second depends on the wavelength. That number, also known as the frequency, will be larger for a short-wavelength wave than for a long-wavelength wave.

The equation that relates wavelength and frequency for electromagnetic waves is:

$$c = \lambda  \cdot \nu$$

where \\(\lambda\\) is the wavelength, \\(\nu\\) is the frequency and \\(c\\) is the speed of light.

When a wave passes from one medium to another, its frequency remains the same. If the velocities of the wave in the two media differ, the wavelengths in the two media also differ as a consequence the above equation.

As the frequency of a wave does not depend on the medium the wave is passing, it is more convenient to use frequency instead of wavelength to characterize the wave. In acoustics, this is common practice - in most cases the pitch of sound is characterized by its frequency instead of its wavelength in a certain medium (for example air). In optics, the situation is different. In most cases wavelength is used instead of frequency, although this leads to a certain complication complication. For example, green light has a wavelength of 520 nm in vacuum, but in water its velocity is smaller by a factor of 1.33 and thus, in water the same green light has a wavelength of only 520/1.33 = 391.0 nm. Hence, if we want to characterize a wave by its wavelength, we also have to state for which medium the actual wavelength value is given. According to CIE regulations, the term "wavelength" refers to "wavelength in air" unless otherwise stated. However, when applying the given wavelength figures to light passing through a medium other than vacuum, one should keep in mind that the light's wavelength changes according to the relation:

$${\lambda _{medium}} = \frac{\lambda _{vacuum}}{n_{medium}} = {\lambda _{air}}\frac{n_{air}}{n_{medium}}$$

with $$n_{air} = \frac{c_{vacuum}}{c_{air}}$$

and $$n_{medium} = \frac{c_{vacuum}}{c_{medium}}$$

$$n_{medium}$$ is called the medium's index of refraction and is more commonly used to specify the optical properties of a material than $$c_{medium}$$.
