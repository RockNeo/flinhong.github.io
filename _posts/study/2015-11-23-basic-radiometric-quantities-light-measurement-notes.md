description: The whole discipline of optical measurement techniques can be roughly subdivided into the two areas of photometry and radiometry. Whereas the central problem of photometry is the determination of optical quantities closely related to the sensitivity of the human eye, radiometry deals with the measurement of energy per time (that is power, given in watts) emitted by light sources or impinging on a particular surface. Thus, the units of all radiometric quantities are based on watts (W).

The whole discipline of optical measurement techniques can be roughly subdivided into the two areas of **photometry** and **radiometry**. Whereas the central problem of photometry is the determination of optical quantities closely related to the sensitivity of the human eye, radiometry deals with the measurement of energy per time (that is power, given in watts) emitted by light sources or impinging on a particular surface. Thus, the units of all radiometric quantities are based on **watts (W)**. According to CIE regulations, symbols for radiometric quantities are denoted with the subscript "e" for "energy". Similarly, radiometric quantities given as a function of wavelength are labeled with the prefix "spectral" and the subscript "\\(\lambda\\)" (for example spectral radiant \\({\Phi _\lambda }\\) ).

**Remark:** The definition of radiometric quantities cannot be understood without a basic comprehension of different quantities. For an intuitive understanding of these quantities, the differential quantities \\({d\lambda}\\), \\({dA}\\) and \\({d\Omega}\\) can be regarded as tiny intervals or elements \\(\Delta \lambda \\), \\(\Delta A\\) and \\(\Delta \Omega \\) of the respective quantity. As a consequence of the fact that these intervals or elements are very small, radiometric quantities can be considered constant over the range defined by \\({d\lambda}\\), \\({dA}\\) and/or \\({d\Omega}\\). Similarly, \\(d{\Phi _e}\\), \\(d{I_e}\\) and \\(d{E_e}\\) can be regarded as small portions which add up to the total value of the respective quantity.
